## Description
I have developed a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, I wrote unit tests for each part of my code and ensured that it passed all of them.  
  
Because this application won’t be deployed, I’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

## Usage
Use this application to generate a project README.md file.
